**How to align and float images on your website**

** **

**HTML and CSS can be both used to display align and float images on your website. In this ar cle, we’ll show you how to use HTML to align images to text (or other page elements) and how to use CSS to float images, wrapping text around it as you’d see in a newspaper or magazine.**

**Before we dive into the code, let’s look at the difference between aligned and floated images.**


        **	Aligned images: using image align, you can choose a le  , center, or right placement. The text doesn’t flow around the image but will be placed before or a 	er it (as a block), depending on the chosen alignment.**


        **	Floated images: when an image is floated, the text flows around the image. You can easily define addi onal CSS rules to ensure sufficient whitespace around the image. Float rules are also commonly used to arrange images in horizontal rows, as you find with image galleries and thumbnail selectors.**

**We’ll first go through the steps for aligning images with HTML, then show you how to float images with CSS.**


# **HTML image alignment**


**Follow the steps below to image align to the le , the center, or the right of your webpage.**


## 
**Le  align**


**Use the following HTML code to align an image to the le  :**


```
    <div style="text-align: left;"><img src="myimage.jpg" width="100" alt="My Image" /></div>
```



**As you can see, the image is le -aligned, with the text displayed on the right.**


## **Right align**

**Now use this HTML code to align the image to the right of the text:**


```
    <div style="text-align: right;"><img src="myimage.jpg" width="100" alt="My Image" /></div>
```



## **Center align**

**To embed the image within the text, use the following code:**


```
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="myimage.jpg" width="100" alt="My Image" /></div>
```


**This code will embed the image in the paragraphs, but it’s not a very clean layout.**


## 
**Top and bo om align**

**Alongside le , right, and center alignment, you can use top and bo   	om alignment to define the arrangement of the text and image.**


```
    <img src="myimage.jpg" width="100" alt="My Image" style="vertical-align: top;" />
```


**With top alignment, no ce how the Sed feugiat ncidunt tellus text aligns with the top right of the image.**


```
    <img src="myimage.jpg" width="100" alt="My Image" style="vertical-align:
    bottom;"/>
```



**With bo om alignment, the same text aligns to the bo om right of the image instead.**

**While HTML image alignment offers solu ons for basic layouts, floa ng images with CSS code can offer more flexibility.**


# **CSS floa ng images**

**Follow these steps to float images on your website to the right or le	and use the “no float” or “clear” forma     	ng.**


## **Floa ng images right with text wrapping**

**In this example, we include the image tag in our HTML file, but iden fy the image with an ID (“hp”).**


```
    <img src="hp.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" id="hp"/>
```


**The forma 	ng code is called from a separate CSS file, which includes the float:right rule, plus some addi onal spacing, courtesy of the margin rule.**


```
    #hp  { float: right; 	margin: 0 0 0 15px; }
```


**As you can see, the resul ng layout is neater, with text wrapping below the image.**


## 
**Floa ng images le with text wrapping**

**With the image correctly tagged in the HTML file, you can simply edit the CSS rule to experiment with alterna ve layouts.**


```
    #hp  { float: left; 	margin: 0 15px 0 0; }
```



## **No float**

**Use the float:none rule to display the image in the text without any wrapping. You can retain the margin rule (if desired) for spacing.**


```
    #hp  { float: none; 	margin: 0 15px 0 0; }
```



## **Clearing floats**

**When floa ng images, it’s important that you use the clear rule correctly. Floated images (and other web elements) will overlap one another if you do not “clear” the float. Be sure to use the clear rule a  er each sec on in which an image is floa ng.**

**In this example, we have two sec ons (using div tags), one containing an image and the second containing an image, some text, and a red border. The first sec on is posi oned using the float:le rule, and you can see that it overlaps the second sec on.**

**The overlap occurs because we have not used the clear rule. Apply the following CSS rule to the second div:**


```
    .div2 {
     	border: 1px solid red;
     	clear: both; }
```


**You can now see that the two sec ons are now no longer overlapping. The clear rule can be used with a number of values:**


    **none – allows floa ng elements on both sides. le      	– no floa ng elements allowed on the le      	side. right– no floa ng elements allowed on the right side. both – no floa ng elements allowed on either side. inherit – inherits the clear value of its parent.**
